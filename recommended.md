Every now and then I stumble across a cool project or tool that I instantly want to tell all my colleagues about. This
list below is a history of such things so I can keep everything in one place, it may as well be of use to someone!

- [mockery](https://github.com/padraic/mockery) - I never start a php project without including Mockery as a mandatory dev dependency. It offers fantastic mocking functionality and is heaps easier to use that PHPUnit built in library;

- [pirum](http://pirum.sensiolabs.org) - great tool to quickly start and manage a PEAR channel + clever [instruction](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/04/how-to-serve-php-packages-with-github/) on how to leverage github's gh-pages functionality to host your PEAR channel;

- [sami](https://github.com/fabpot/sami) - documentation generator, way better than the good 'ol phpDoc;

- [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) - 'abstraction' layer for VM management, top way to quickly create dev VMs;

- [faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) - dummy test data quickly, or how I read it once 'the ultimate lorem ipsum for PHP';

- [behat and mink](http://behat.org) - BDD for PHP, definitely one to know and use;

- [slim](http://www.slimframework.com) - my favorite 'quick-fix' framework, best solution when I need to mock somethign up quickly.

To investigate:

- [plates](https://github.com/reinink/Plates) - native php templating as an alternative to compiled twig;

- [docker](https://www.docker.io) - vagrant idea taken further by the use of linux containers.

Watch this space for further updates...
